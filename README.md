## GEOG458 Lab 2 Submission <br>
The two included maps and word charts represent tweets gathered throughout the United States of America on two different occasions. The first map represents the locations of tweets made with geolocations within the United States on a Friday evening. The second map and word chart represent tweets that were made with geolocations within the United States as well however these tweets were gathered on a Monday evening instead. While both sets of maps and charts represent tweets gathered from within the United States, the goal is to compare both the regions and frequently occuring phrases which are apparent on different days. With the initial map representing the beginning of the weekend, and the second map representing the beginning of the week, it is expected to see a contrast between the two. <br>

### Word Clouds

The initial word cloud represents the most common phrases used in tweets on the night of Friday April 22nd and the following image represents the most common phrases on Monday April 25th. When viewing the two images one aspect that is noticeable between the two is the subject matter. On the first image most of the phrases included are general words such as "love", "time", "night", and "thank" which are understandbale for a typical Friday night. On Monday's cloud two very prominent words include "Twitter" and "Elon Musk" which likely alludes to the news of the businessman planning to purchase the company which was likely a massive topic on the platform. Another notable aspect is that while the words "fuck" and "shit" appear in the first word cloud, albeit small and in the background, they are much more prominent on Monday's cloud which may suggest a shift in the overall tone and emotions of tweets over this weekend.

### Maps

When comparing the two maps, the two patterns share much more in common with eachother than the previous two word clouds. Both maps show a heavy concentration of tweets coming from three main regions, the West Coast, East Coast, and the South. Likewise, in both images there are far fewer tweets coming from the Midwest which can likely be attributed to the region being far less dense population wise as well as the increase in rural areas which may lack accessibility to high speed internet as frequently as in other more urban areas. While the patterns remain similar over the course of the weekend, this may suggest that these are the most common regions for users to Tweet from in general, regardless of the day of the week.
