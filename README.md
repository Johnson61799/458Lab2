The two included maps and word charts represent tweets gathered throughout the United States of America on two different occasions. The first map represents the locations of tweets made with geolocations within the United States on a Saturday evening. The second map and word chart represent tweets that were made with geolocations within the United States as well however these tweets were gathered on a Monday evening instead. While both sets of maps and charts represent tweets gathered from within the United States, the goal is to compare both the regions and frequently occuring phrases which are apparent on different days. With the initial map representing the beginning of the weekend, and the second map representing the beginning of the week, it is expected to see a contrast between the two.
